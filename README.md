Yoontown Rhavenge is a top-down shoot'em up game. Our game takes inspiration from [Bullet Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_hell), a subgenre of shoot'em up games also known as **manic shooter**. The game is written in Python 3.14 and utilizes the popular [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) library. All classes for the game are located in [ytr_classes.py](ytr_classes.py) and the configs are located in [ytr_config.py](ytr_config.py). All sprites and sound tracks were made from scratch specifically for the game.

After a certain amount of damage The Rhavenger of Yoontown enters into phase 2, where it unlocks new attacks and the patterns become harder for the player to dodge.
